Next Todos:
- renaming of library?
- comparison to supported locales (otherwise default)
- better templating (integration in view engine, keys?, {}, {0} args?
- tutorial
- licencing
- tests?
- package json
- npm publishing
- npm coding styles

Future Todos:
- that would be sexy:
  <h3>__('messages.hello.name.surname', [{{name}}, {{surname}},{{locale}}])</h3>

Maybes:
- male/female rendering? plural singular rendering? (or should the user do this himself?)
- translation API integration (JSON)
